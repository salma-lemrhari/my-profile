    <p>
    Salma, 18, Rouen (Normandy). I am passionate about music and everything related to fashion, from fashion photography to the history of fashion as I wish to work in the fashion & luxury industry.

	<h2> Music </h2>
    <p>
    I played violin for 11 years. Until last year, I was part of the Conservatoire of Rouen and a member of the symphonic orchestra. Thanks to the Conservatoire, I had the opportunity to participate to an international festival called the Eurochestries which took place in China in 2018, but also to play at the Shanghai Concert Hall and at UNESCO.

	<h2> Fashion </h2>
    <p>
	I consider fashion as a form of art. Indeed, fashion is all about expressing ourselves through clothes and accessoiries. Moreover, I love the idea that fashion has no boundaries: during fashion shows, designers can be inspired by everything and nothing. As a consequence, their creations can take any form, and every form is appreciated in its own way.

	<h2> Books </h2>
    <p>
	As long as I can remember, I have always loved reading. The simple action of holding a book in my hand and turning its pages seems comforting to me. But what I enjoy the most in books is their capacity to bring you to another world, whether it be similar to the world we are living in, or a fantasy world, with different living conditions and  creatures which could only exist in our imagination. Whatever the author's choice, I am grateful for his or her ability to make me believe in something which doesn't exist.
